# PongClone

PongClone... One of the earliest video games in existence.  This is just a simple implementation of pong to get 
into the mood of creating simple games using Processing.

This is currently a work in progress as some of the features have not been implemented (mostly GUI) but you can play against an opponent if you want. 

So far, some of the things that need to be done include: 
* Adding some UI elements such as menus and high scores
